### Hi, I'm Thivanka 👋.

I'm a Robotics Ph.D. candidate at the University of Rhode Island who is passionate about probabilistic multi-target filters, sensor-fusion, and robot localization. Apart from my work, I’m passionate about wildlife photography 📷.

🔭 I'm currently working on genetic algorithm optimization on variables for a particle filter tracking of algae blooms on fresh water lakes.
